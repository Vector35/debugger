# Binary Ninja Debugger

This is the repository for Binary Ninja Debugger. The debugger is written in C++ and is shipped with BN as a plugin.

## Platform and Target Support

This is the current comparability matrix of the debugger. The horizontal lines stand for where we run BN and the vertical lines stand for the targets.

| DebugAdapter Protocol | Planned            | Planned            | Planned            |      |

Explanation:
- `Yes` means the feature is supported.
- `Planned` means that we plan to implement it.
- `TBD` means that we have not decided whether to support it, or how to support it.
- `No` means it is not possible to do, at least for now.

Notes:

(1). Right now, we only support gdbserver with android remote debugging. Support for other gdbserver or gdb stub, e.g., qiling, VMWare, QEMU, will be added later.

The progress is tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/Vector35/debugger/issues/122).
